# My ToDo App âœ“

I developed a To-Do List iOS application using Swift and integrated the Realm database framework. The app allows users to create, manage, and organize tasks efficiently. I implemented the user interface, task creation, deletion, and editing functionalities, leveraging Swift's UIKit framework. Integrating Realm enabled seamless storage and retrieval of tasks, enhancing data persistence and synchronization across devices.
